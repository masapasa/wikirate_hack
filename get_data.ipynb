To measure\\ngender diversity on corporate boards, studies often use the percentage of\\nwomen holding corporate board seats and the percentage of companies with at\\nleast one woman on their board. Globally, men occupy more board seats than\\nwomen. Indeed, in 2015, women held 17.9% of the board seats on Fortune 1000\\ncompanies.\\n\\nThe reasons behind the disproportionate gender ratio of directors is a subject\\nof much debate. A survey of more than 4000 directors found that male directors\\nover the age of 55 cited a lack of qualified female candidates as the main\\nreason behind the stagnant number of female directors. In contrast, in the\\nsame study, female directors and younger male directors considered the male-\\ndominated networking that often led to the appointment of directors to be the\\nreason behind women's slow progress.\\n\\nGiven that gender diversity on boards is an issue rooted in the principle of\\nequality of treatment, inequality in gender representation on boards can be\\ncombatted through equality of opportunity reforms or equality of outcome\\nreforms. Governments and corporations have attempted to address the\\ndisproportionality of gender representation on corporate boards through both\\ntypes of measures, including legislation mandating gender quotas (a reform\\nbased on the principle of equality of outcome) and comply or explain\\nguidelines (a reform based on the principle of equality of opportunity).\\n\\nSource:\\n[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender_representation_on_corporate_boards_of_directors|Wikipedia]]\\n\\n\", 'methodology': 'This metric is looking for the **percentage of women on the company\\'s board of\\ndirectors**.

These targets aim, for example, to achieve\\nuniversal access to safe and affordable drinking water, improve water quality,\\nand address water scarcity.\\n\\nThe amount of water withdrawn and consumed by an organization and the quality\\nof its discharges, can impact the functioning of the ecosystem in numerous\\nways.

To measure\\ngender diversity on corporate boards, studies often use the percentage of\\nwomen holding corporate board seats and the percentage of companies with at\\nleast one woman on their board. Globally, men occupy more board seats than\\nwomen. Indeed, in 2015, women held 17.9% of the board seats on Fortune 1000\\ncompanies.\\n\\nThe reasons behind the disproportionate gender ratio of directors is a subject\\nof much debate. A survey of more than 4000 directors found that male directors\\nover the age of 55 cited a lack of qualified female candidates as the main\\nreason behind the stagnant number of female directors. In contrast, in the\\nsame study, female directors and younger male directors considered the male-\\ndominated networking that often led to the appointment of directors to be the\\nreason behind women's slow progress.\\n\\nGiven that gender diversity on boards is an issue rooted in the principle of\\nequality of treatment, inequality in gender representation on boards can be\\ncombatted through equality of opportunity reforms or equality of outcome\\nreforms. Governments and corporations have attempted to address the\\ndisproportionality of gender representation on corporate boards through both\\ntypes of measures, including legislation mandating gender quotas (a reform\\nbased on the principle of equality of outcome) and comply or explain\\nguidelines (a reform based on the principle of equality of opportunity).\\n\\n\", 'methodology': 'To find what percentage of a company\\'s board of directors are women, look for\\nthe details on a company\\'s website or in their sustainability or annual\\nreports.

Diversity and gender are\\ncross-cutting themes that permeate into all other poverty indicators.** More\\nspecifically, within this dimension, this particular indicator addresses the\\ncategory Diversity, Cultural Rights and Right to Freedom from Discrimination.  \\n  \\nThis indicator, furthermore, falls under the 3rd Corporate area Dimension,\\ninstitutions and policy, which refers to how the company’s actions regarding\\ninstitutions and policy affect the well-being of people living in developing\\ncountries. It considers the effects of lobbying, direct investment,\\nprocurement and distribution practices in relation to the development of\\ninstitutions (such as producer organizations, unions, social networks, women’s\\ngroups) and policies that focus on trade, finance, education, rule of law, and\\nhealth.  \\n  \\n*It is important to note that this guide is for reference purposes only. It suggests indicators that project partners may consider, but it is not a complete or exhaustive list.
