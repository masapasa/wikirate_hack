The elimination of all PFCs - as a chemical group - is an essential part of responsible chemical use for all Detox leaders. Adidas is the first Detox committed company which has a significant number of products that are \u2018high-end outdoors\u2019. As an interim step, adidas has publicly committed to all of their product lines being 99% PFC-free by no later than 31 Dec 2017 as it progresses towards being 100% PFC-free across all product lines - as they committed - by no later than 31 Dec 2019. Greenpeace fully expects adidas Group to rapidly reach elimination of 100% of all PFCs and will continue to motivate all companies - including adidas - to deliver on their promises.",
